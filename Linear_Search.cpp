/*Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. */

/*Given an array arr[] of N elements, the task is to write a function to search a given element x in arr[].*/
/*Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.*/

// is present then return its location, otherwise
// return -1
